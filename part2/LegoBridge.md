# Building the Golden Gate Bridge with Legos
Let's start with the Lego dimensions of a classic 2 x 4 Brick
- width = .0096m
- length = .032m
- height = .016m

##### So the volume of one Lego block is .0096m * .032m * .016m = 4.92 * 10^-6 m^3

Now let's find dimensions of the Golden Gate Towers.
- width = 10m
- length = 15m
- height = 227m

##### So the volume of one Tower is 10m * 15m * 227m = 34,050 m^3

Now let's find dimensions of the Golden Gate Bridge
- width = 27m
- length = 2737m
- height = 10m (estimated by comparing width of tower to height of bridge as seen in pictures)

##### So the volume of the Bridge is 27m * 2737m * 10m = 738,990 m^3

The Golden Gate Bridge has 2 Towers and 1 Bridge
##### So the total volume of the Golden Gate Bridge is 2(Tower) + Bridge = 2(34,050 m^3) + 738,990 m^3 = 807,090 m^3

If there is 807,090 m^3 per Golden Gate and 4.92 * 10^-6 m^3 per Brick,

##### 807,090 m^3 / 4.92 * 10^-6 m^3 = 1.64 * 10^11 or
# 164 billion Lego Bricks

Now it's time for some shawarma
